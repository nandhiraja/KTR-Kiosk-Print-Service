# Put your logo.ico file here

This folder is for your custom application icon.

## What to place here:
- logo.ico - Your restaurant/company logo in .ico format (256x256 recommended)

## How to create logo.ico:
1. Get your logo image (PNG, JPG, etc.)
2. Convert to .ico format:
   - Online: https://convertio.co/png-ico/
   - Or use image editing software

## After placing logo.ico here:
Run: npm run build:icon

Your .exe will have your custom icon instead of the Node.js logo!
